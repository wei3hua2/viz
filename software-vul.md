`Manual analysis`

Work to address the problem of manual analysis was started as early as in 1998 by Cowan et al. (1998) and Ghosh et al. (1998). Since then, numerous works have addressed the problem of manual analysis using a variety of different approaches

i. Tedious and time limitation 
ii. Quality of the detection performance
